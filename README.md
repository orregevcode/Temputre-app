# Temperature Control App

This is a simple React application that allows users to control and visualize temperature changes. The app consists of a temperature display, along with buttons to increment and decrement the temperature value.

## Features:

- **Increment and Decrement:** Users can increase or decrease the temperature value by clicking on the respective buttons.
- **Dynamic Styling:** The background color of the temperature display changes based on the temperature value. It reflects a color scheme indicating cold, neutral, or hot temperatures.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Interact with the buttons to adjust the temperature and observe the dynamic styling changes.

## Technologies Used:

- **React:** Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState:** React hook for managing component state.
- **CSS:** Stylesheets for defining the appearance of the components.
